PROJECT TITLE: Data Analysis Capstone Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To make a class with a series of methods to analyze data to see if there is any relation between the data points
VERSION or DATE: v1 4/12/16
DEPENDENCIES:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Alex Komar
USER INSTRUCTIONS:  Run any of the test methods in the AnalysisTest class


Explanation: I used loops and boolean algebra in my main loops. I used sorting methods to clean my arrays.


Algorithim: My isExponential algorithim worked by first checking to see if the data was grouped any way.
            If it was grouped it would then check if the first groups average squared was about the 
            value of the average of the second grouping. If so a variable went up one. Using a for loop
            it went through and checked all of the groups like this. If the count variable equaled one less
            than the number of groups than the method returned true that the data grows exponentially.
